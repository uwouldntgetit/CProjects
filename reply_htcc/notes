There are turns
there is a budget D
each turn has:
- min buildings num Tm
- max buildings num	Tx
- profit per building Tr

the budget is updated after every turn
revenue (rev):
if Tm isn't reached:
	rev = 0;
else:
	n = "num buildings";
	rev = min(n, Tx) * Tr;

from revenue are subtracted periodic costs
At the end of turn D += rev

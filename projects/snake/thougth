Idea:
I want to create a terminal snake game, basic functions are:
- snake moves every .5 seconds
- snake becomes bigger for every apple it eats
- every 2 seconds an apple is spawned
- the points are ccalculated as sum(specific_num_apples * seconds_with_score). It means that the time spent with a specific number of apples is multiplied by that same number of apples. All those values are
    then added to one another.

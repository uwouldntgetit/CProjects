program to simulate a library management system

 functions to implement:
 - to store books in a file V
 -- to select a specific file as the storage V
 -- to read a file V
 - to delete a book 
 - to lend and return books(similar to the one above)
 -- to check that the book is currently present in the storage
 --- to mark the book as lent or returned
 - to view records of books issued and returned

first thing to do is to build the program's skeleton, so i will make a simple program to
open, read and then write in a schematic way the book name and if it's present or not

the basic idea of the project is to create a clone of the grep program, it will not take any option because it will be difficult enough to implement variable lenght arguments.
to take the vlargs, i'll have to create two different char matrixes, one for the regexs and one for the filenames, and they'll be implemented using both realloc and pointer arithmetic.
for the regexs the program will read the content of a string included between "" symbols, and it will be allowed to have spaces inside it; i will simply create a char array of 1024 chars and i'll specify that that is the maximum length for regexes. Inside that array i'll store the content of the regex and then i will realloc the general regex matrix to account for the length of another element.
for the filenames it will basically be the same thing. after all that, i will create a for cycle that opens a specific file of the filename matrix, checks if any of the regexes are inside it, if they are it prints the line it was found in, then the file is closed and the next one is opened until all the files have been opened. then the program ends.

#+title: Project Ideas


* Logical arguments creator V1.0
** inserted an argument form (P-->Q), it automatically build an argument with the help of the user
** the user has to input the statements for P and Q, and the program builds the argument
** The argument form to implement are: modus ponens, modus tollens, transitivity, specialization, elimination
** Subjects to study for this project:
*** taking a string as an input from the user
*** manipulatin strings

** Starting screen
*** welcome message
*** choose between string mode(the user inserts actual arguments) and theoretical arguments mode(P,Q,...)

** Input screen
*** print supported argument forms
*** explain how to write the argument(for P-->q for example, the user has to write "if" before the argument, and has to write "then" to divide it, else it will be illegal)
*** take in input the premises and the conclusion (in V 1.0 the supported premises are only 2)

** End screen
*** print argument form
*** print result
*** ask if user wants to play again

* PROJ Functions to implement (KEEP IT SIMPLE!!!)
- take in input two premises and a conclusion (in an argument form way) and put them in a char array
- checks for spelled logical operators (if-then, not, and, or, therefore)
